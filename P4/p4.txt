turnin id:  aos_p4


Enhance the shell from p3 to support the new facilities described below.


Enhance the shell's capabilities with support for two new builtin commands
named shmalloc and shmdel:

    shmalloc SHM_NAME SHM_SIZE_IN_MB
        makes a posix-compatible shared memory area available for subsequent
        programs to use (mmap and shm_open); note that multiple processes
        can share the area simultaneously
    shmdel  SHM_NAME
        removes the shared memory area (shm_unlink)


Submitting the project for grading:

The project should compile and link as p4.

You should turnin a tar file containing all of the required files.

To build the project, I will cd to my directory containing your files
and simply type:

    rm -rf p4
    rm -rf *.o
    make
