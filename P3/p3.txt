turnin id:  aos_p3


Enhance the shell from p2 to support the new facilities described below.



Enhance the shell's capabilities with new support for handling signals so
that you can provide some job control.  Assume that there will never be 
more than 4 processes to manage (foreground, background, suspended).
Also, for simplicity, assume that no task placed into the background will
attempt to read from stdin.

    ^Z on fg process suspends it
        Cause the foreground process to be suspended.

    jobs
        Builtin command to list current jobs (suspended or background).
        List each with a num beside it to be used in following commands.

    kill num
        Builtin command to cause the specified process to be sent
        the -KILL signal.

    fg num
        Builtin command to cause the specified suspended or background
        process to become the foreground process.  In this context, the
        foreground process is merely the one which the shell is waiting
        for to complete.

    bg num
        Builtin command to cause the specified suspended process to
        run in the background.  The shell will not wait for the process
        to complete because it is in the background.  Of course, the 
        shell may still perform a wait operation as part of handling a
        SIGCHLD for the process.


Submitting the project for grading:

The project should compile and link as p3.

You should turnin a tar file containing all of the required files.

To build the project, I will cd to my directory containing your files
and simply type:

    rm -rf p3
    rm -rf *.o
    make
