turnin code: aos_p6


This program will take a single command-line arg.  If the command-line arg
is not present, then print an error message and quit.  The arg specifies
the name of a function to be loaded via the dlopen interface.

You should create a dynamic library that contains two functions that can
be invoked: p6f1 and p6f2.  The dynamic library should be named libp6.so
when created by your makefile.  Each function should print its own name
and the pid of the process in which it is running.

When I type "make", libp6.so should be built first followed by the
program named p6 which provides dynamic-load access to the library.

To run the program, I will make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to 
the current directory.  Then I will run it by typing commands like:
    ./p6 p6f1
    ./p6 p6f2
    ./p6 not_there


Submitting the project for grading:

You should turnin a tar file containing all of the required files.

To build the project, I will cd to my directory containing your files
and simply type:

    rm -rf *.o
    rm -rf libp6.so p6 
    make    ## as described above, this builds libp6.so THEN p6
